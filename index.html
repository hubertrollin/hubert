<h2 class="titlev1">Whole Lotta Red V1</h2>
<p class="text">The first version of Whole Lotta Red was heavily inspired by the sound and style of Die Lit, continuing Playboi Carti’s exploration of hazy, atmospheric trap beats. Carti maintained his creative partnership with Pi’erre Bourne, who returned as the project’s primary producer and helped shape its sonic foundation. However, this new material marked a noticeable shift in Carti’s vocal delivery. He began to lean more heavily into what would later become known as his signature "baby voice" — a high-pitched, almost cartoonish inflection that added a surreal edge to his already experimental approach. This vocal style became especially prominent on standout leaks like “Pissy Pamper” and “Goku,” both of which gained cult-like popularity online, further fueling anticipation for the album. Just a month after the release of Die Lit in May 2018, Carti gave fans an early look at what he had been working on by previewing the track “Buffy the Body” during a private Instagram Live session. At the time, he referred to the project as Die Lit 2, suggesting a direct continuation of the chaotic, punk-inspired energy that had made his previous release such a standout. By August of that year, however, a video surfaced of Carti referring to the album by a new title — Whole Lotta Red. This change signaled that the project was evolving into something more ambitious, with Carti beginning to cultivate a darker, more stylized persona that would eventually define the final version of the album.</p>

        The second iteration of Whole Lotta Red marked the height of Playboi Carti’s experimental phase, with his “baby voice” and high-pitched, erratic vocal delivery pushed to their furthest limits. This version saw Carti working with a broader range of producers beyond Pi’erre Bourne, including Richie Souf and Maaly Raw, layering his vocals over a blend of ethereal synth-driven instrumentals and aggressive trap percussion. The sound was chaotic, unconventional, and at times abrasive—qualities that polarized fans upon the release of the single “@ MEH.” The track, which showcased Carti’s exaggerated vocal tics over a glossy, synth-heavy beat, was met with widespread confusion and backlash, with many listeners dismissing it as unlistenable. In response to the mixed reception, Carti decided to scrap much of the second version and rework the project entirely, signaling another dramatic shift in direction. This era was not only defined by sonic experimentation but also by a major shift in Carti’s image. The @ MEH single cover—featuring Carti with bleached-blonde hair and re-twisted dreads—became emblematic of this transitional phase. His aesthetic leaned heavily into avant-garde and goth-inspired fashion, most notably through his embrace of Rick Owens, Raf Simons, and other high-concept designers. He also began to prominently feature the upside-down cross in his visuals and performances, symbolizing a break from mainstream hip-hop norms and tying into the occult-inspired themes of his Opium collective. While the second version of Whole Lotta Red was never officially released in full, it has since become a cult favorite among fans. Many of the leaks and unreleased tracks from this era are now considered grails, with the V2 sound viewed in hindsight as one of Carti’s most daring and influential creative periods.</p>

    <p class="text3">After the death of his close friend Bigg Sosa, Playboi Carti retreated from the spotlight, delaying the release of his long-awaited second studio album Whole Lotta Red and going silent on social media until October. This period marked a noticeable shift in his music and image. While Carti has never been known for deep lyricism, tracks from this era—such as “ILoveUIHateU”—offer rare glimpses into his emotional state, touching on themes of grief and addiction. The music took on a more somber, atmospheric tone, reflecting a darker mindset as Carti coped with loss and pressure. Around this time, Carti also began transitioning away from his polarizing baby-voice delivery, opting instead for a rougher, more aggressive vocal style that would later define much of Whole Lotta Red. This evolution was partly a response to the heavy criticism he faced, pushing him to explore a sound that felt more raw and visceral. According to leakers, there was a finalized version of the album completed in September, featuring a different tracklist and tone—but this version likely won’t ever see the light of day, leaving fans to speculate on what Whole Lotta Red might have been.</p>

<h2>Whole Lotta Red V4 (Final Version)</h2>
<div class="final">
    <img src="img/e9ceaf7cd32248217779c4db532b39ca.png" alt="" class="finalimg">
    <p class="text4">In late 2020, Playboi Carti shifted the direction of *Whole Lotta Red* into a chaotic, aggressive tribute to punk rock aesthetics—his most radical sonic departure to date. While maintaining the repetitive and hypnotic vocal patterns that defined his earlier success, Carti abandoned many of the elements that had built his core fanbase. Gone were the lush, melodic beats from Pi'erre Bourne and high-profile features from frequent collaborators like Lil Uzi Vert and A$AP Rocky. Instead, the album leaned heavily on raw, abrasive production from F1LTHY and Art Dealer, with only a few guest appearances. Executive produced by Kanye West, the album finally dropped on Christmas Day 2020, cementing its mythic status after years of leaks and delays. Tying back to themes explored in the V3 era, Carti channels the grief from Bigg Sosa’s death into raw emotion, transforming pain into rage across the album. On tracks like “On That Time,” “Stop Breathing,” and “No Sl33p,” he explores not just sorrow, but a violent need for vengeance and release. The anger is palpable—his delivery unfiltered and primal—as he swaps sorrowful introspection for the fury of someone who’s lost a brother. This fusion of personal trauma and punk energy gave *Whole Lotta Red* a polarizing edge, but also marked a bold new chapter in Carti’s artistic evolution.</p>
